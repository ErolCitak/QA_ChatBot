**Evaluation and Analysis: RAG-LangChain vs. Raw LLM Approaches**

---

## 1. RAG - LangChain Based LLM Evaluation

```json
{
    'ROUGE-1': {'Precision': 0.3257, 'Recall': 0.1272, 'F1': 0.1825},
    'ROUGE-2': {'Precision': 0.0625, 'Recall': 0.0245, 'F1': 0.0352},
    'ROUGE-L': {'Precision': 0.2105, 'Recall': 0.0838, 'F1': 0.1195}
}
```

**Observations:**
- **Precision** is relatively high, especially in ROUGE-1 (~32%).
- **Recall** is quite low, indicating limited coverage of the ground truth.
- **ROUGE-2** scores are low, suggesting that the bigram continuity in answers is weak.
- **ROUGE-L** scores suggest some preservation of answer structure but with limited depth.

**Interpretation:**
The RAG-based pipeline generates **short but accurate** responses, focusing more on correctness than breadth.

## 2. Raw LLM Based Evaluation

```json
{
    'ROUGE-1': {'Precision': 0.1396, 'Recall': 0.4659, 'F1': 0.2101},
    'ROUGE-2': {'Precision': 0.0281, 'Recall': 0.0908, 'F1': 0.0420},
    'ROUGE-L': {'Precision': 0.0912, 'Recall': 0.3052, 'F1': 0.1374}
}
```

**Observations:**
- **Precision** is much lower compared to the RAG setup.
- **Recall** is significantly higher, especially in ROUGE-1 (~46%).
- **ROUGE-2** scores are slightly better than the RAG-based evaluation but still low.
- **ROUGE-L** scores mirror ROUGE-1 results, confirming the broader but less precise generation.

**Interpretation:**
The raw LLM produces **broad and verbose** answers, attempting to cover more content but with lower overall accuracy.

## 3. Comparative Summary

| Metric          | RAG-LangChain | Raw LLM |
|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| Precision       | High          | Low     |
| Recall          | Low           | High    |
| F1 Score        | Moderate      | Moderate |
| Answer Structure | Concise & Focused | Verbose & Broad |
| Coverage        | Narrow        | Wide    |

**Key Takeaways:**
- **RAG-LangChain** is better suited for applications where **precision and factual accuracy** are critical.
- **Raw LLM** can be more useful in **brainstorming or creative generation** scenarios where wider coverage is needed despite possible inaccuracies.

## 4. Conclusion

The evaluation clearly indicates that the RAG-LangChain pipeline improves the precision of LLM responses by grounding them in retrieved documents, making it a highly suitable approach for use cases demanding high factual accuracy. In contrast, relying solely on a raw LLM model provides broader but less reliable outputs.

In practical applications, the choice between RAG-augmented and raw LLM outputs should be made based on the trade-off between **accuracy** and **coverage** depending on the specific use case.
